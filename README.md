Fed up of explaining directions to friends on phones or while talking. Now no need to guide or explain any more...just share the path! 
MyPath.IO lets you CREATE AND SHARE ANY PATH, while moving one location to another and the app stores the path and later on available for share.
The application can be used in many different ways for eg: sharing a path with friends, in public transport tracking system, tourist can use the shared path etc.
